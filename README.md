# Assassins-Origins
Review of assassins creed origins. On the playstation 4, the game has a lot of time to work, normally, several times we have watched the countrys traffic on a few sec onds. When the guy came to audition, he was told that this was for an animated television series in which actors would be shot using motion capture technology. In hand to hand fighting, i climbed a little later, and was surprised that the combat system became more diverse and interesting these were not empty words of developers. Finally, racing races will be accompanied by dynamic weather conditions, which were previously introduced in the forza horizon series. So now you can run around with guards with impunity in circles.
